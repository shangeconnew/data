Collecting many samples programmatically
Using R, we’re going to collect many samples to learn more about how sample means and confidence intervals vary from one sample to another.

Here is the rough outline:

Obtain a random sample.

Calculate the sample’s mean and standard deviation, and use these to calculate and store the lower and upper bounds of the confidence intervals.

Repeat these steps 50 times.

We can accomplish this using the rep_sample_n function. (This is a function of oilabs package!) The following lines of code takes 50 random samples of size n from population (and remember we defined n=60 earlier), and computes the upper and lower bounds of the confidence intervals based on these samples.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#n=100
#library(purrr)
#set.seed(0815)
#population=rbernoulli(200000, p = 0.748)
#z_star_95 <- qnorm(0.975)
#install.packages(oilabs)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }

#summary(ci_data_new)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
library(purrr)
set.seed(385)
samples <- 100
n <- 200
ll <- numeric(samples)
ul <- numeric(samples)
xbar <- numeric(samples)
for (i in 1:samples)
{
  xbar[i] <- mean(rbernoulli(200, p = 0.748))
  ll[i] <- xbar[i] - qnorm(.95)*sqrt(xbar[i]*(1-xbar[i])/n)
  ul[i] <- xbar[i] + qnorm(.95)*sqrt(xbar[i]*(1-xbar[i])/n)
}

capture_p = ifelse(ll < .748 & ul > .748, "yes", "no")

ci_data_new=data.frame(rep=1:100,trueP=xbar, ul=ul,ll=ll,capture_p=capture_p)
summary(ci_data_new)
library(utils)
head(ci_data_new)
library(ggplot2)
qplot(data = ci_data_new, x = rep, y = trueP,color=capture_p) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin =ll, ymax = ul)) + 
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept =.748), color = "darkgray") + # draw vertical line
  coord_flip()
 
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
